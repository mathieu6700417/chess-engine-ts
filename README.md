# A chess engine in typescript 

This is a new chess engine in typescript. It's still in early development. 
It's heavily influenced by Stockfish 

It implements UCI, the [Universal Chess Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)

It does use the [Forsyth-Edwards Notation](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_Forsyth-Edwards) to represent the chess board.


## Bitboards

This project has been implemented to understand better the concept of [bitboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard)
